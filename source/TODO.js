~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
//@ fix the scrollers
//@ make scrolling thumb
//@ for new accounts, get rid of -> arrow and use the ASCII arrow char
//@ also make ALL accounts the same button as we have everywhere else
	//> to do this use classes 'onyx-blue avatar'
	//> our toolbar classes is "kind: onyx.Toolbar, classes: 'neo-toolbar'"
//@ you can keep the affirmative and negative ones but add those classes to the css
	//> i.e. onyx-blue.avatar, onyx-negative.avatar //etc
//@ make new accounts PRETTY. i.e. make pin like messages, make bottom button look cool etc
	//> i don't mind having the close button grey
//@TODO if you feel ambitious you can try making a small webview that loads the page to login to twitter below
//@ if you can see what's wrong with after you log in the app erroring that'd be sweeeeet...
//@ make navigation in accounts simpler, i.e. make 'cancel' a back button
//@ don't create new components in the bottom toolbar for remove account, i think it's bad.
	//> if you WANT, MODIFY my alert() kind to look more like our app, and use THAT
	//> for our confirm popup. that would be VERY cool.
//@TODO make tapping on the account from accounts view take you to the account
//@ again in the single account screen:
	//> get rid of ascII -> arrow
	//> move back to top left toolbar
	//> move close to top right
//@ can keep remove on bottom.. mayb put info about the account in accounts > xxx @ twitter
	//> like info on data storage, a button to remove the storage..
=====================================

ABOUT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
//@ see if you can fix the undefined undefined in chrome.. it's relating to getappinfo.js
	custom file i made and the actual enyo.fetchappinfo one. mayb you could make
	an enyo.fetchappinfo function that detects where to get the info from..

	//> IDEAS FOR FULL SCREEN
	//> make full screen image of app or app elements and make them tappable
	//> on element tap have popup of different examples user can pick.....
	//> user picks and returns to full screen image of app / elements with updated changes
		//> lots of work, but COOL AS FUCK.

//@ redux all css in all folders to ACTUALLY MAKE SENSE


//@ add a themes folder inside source
vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
//@ separate CSS files
	//> make FOLDERS for CSS, not just separate files, and have a package.js file in each CSS folder
//@ make a .js file for EACH element type
//@ this is just to start. the .js file would be a kind that loads the element popup for the themes page
//@ lastly, the .js file would be called in the app
	//> it could load the theme for that particular element whenever it is rendered
	//> it could also show the element in the master themes page
		//> THIS would make it REAL easy to add our own special themes for the app.

	//> doesn't need to be FANCY just look sorta like the UI
	//> can use some fixed positioning if you want, really, don't get carried away

//@TODO hand pick only the best patterns we want people using
